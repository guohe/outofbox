title: Life of Browser Sessions
summary: Mozilla Test Pilot collects and releases the Firefox browser usage data. I took a piece of it and did some initial analysis on lifespan of browser sessions.

Based on [Mozilla Labs Test Pilot data](https://testpilot.mozillalabs.com/testcases/a-week-life/aggregated-data.html) using [R](http://r-project.org) and [ggplot2](http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/).
There was a long tail cut from the whole graph, though it's already interesting to see people keep their browser open for 10+ hours. This is how much this single piece of software weighs in everyone's daily life now.

More on this to come.
