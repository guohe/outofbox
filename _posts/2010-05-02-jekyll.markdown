title: Jekyll
summary: Jekyll a simple, blog aware, static site generator. I spent one day out of this weekend working on coding to set it up as my new web publishing tool.

After I migrated to [Chyrp](http://chyrp.net) last week, I started to love the feeling of writing things in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). However, chyrp is not cool enough:

- It is based on PHP thus all the pages are generated dynamically.
- I need to open its backend to write stuffs.
- I have to write in the textarea in the web page. No syntax highlight. No auto save ...
- I failed to set up sqlite3 as database backend for Chyrp on [WebFaction](http://webfaction.com).

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) came into my radar just as I was thinking about new opportunities. I have been aware of this cool thing for a while. It is the backbone for [Github](http://github.com) Pages and powers tons of geek weblogs. Comparing to the popular CMS or blog platforms, it is so bareboned in functionality, but it is much more flexible in customization. You have to build the whole thing up from structuring the site and designing the layouts.  But it is better than start from scratch to rewrite an excellent "site generator" like this.

There are a good amount of posts on the web for reference. Below are some of them which helped me a lot:

- [Official Wiki](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/)
- [github.com/mojombo/tpw](http://github.com/mojombo/tpw): examples of site structure and layouts
- [favrik.com](http://github.com/favrik/favrik.com): examples of layouts
- [github.com/roylez](http://github.com/roylez/roylez.github.com): examples of layouts, especially the `index.html`
- [WebFaction Forum / Getting Jekyll Up and Running](http://forum.webfaction.com/viewtopic.php?id=3852): set up on webfaction

It took me some time to migrate my [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) posts to Jekyll. Finally I did this on webfaction side as its mysql and ruby were better configured than my Mac. Chinese posts were all screwed and I haven't found a solution yet.

On deployment, I used the following shell script to sync local site to my server:

	#!/usr/bin/env bash
	jekyll && rsync -avz --delete _site/ userid@userid.webfactional.com:~/path/to/jekyll

Most of the process was just reading documentation and following good examples. It took me almost 12 hours to get to this point and I believe there will be endless polishing work in the future.
