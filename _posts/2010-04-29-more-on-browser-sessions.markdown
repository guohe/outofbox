title: More on Browser Sessions
---

Apparently [it](/blog/2010/04/26/life-of-browser-sessions.html) was only the start. I had to work on other pieces of my life before getting into more detailed analysis.

![Browser session length by OS type](http://connect.decknetwork.net/i/mix11_logo.jpg)

The density plot above was grouped by OS type. The `avg_session_length` was in hours.

- Windows: included various versions of Microsoft Windows
- Mac: included Apple's Mac OS X 10.5+ versions
- Others: included Linux, FreeBSD, Sun Solaris and miscellaneous OS

It is quite interesting to see Windows users have a shorter browser session length compared to Mac users. One reason I could think of is that Mac never really kills the session but hide it in the background instead. Normal users would not be aware of the underlying difference. This should go with the detailed user operation data to understand the true reason behind.

Yet more to come.
