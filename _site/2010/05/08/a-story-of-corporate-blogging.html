    <h3 id='the_story'>The Story</h3>

<p>Thursday morning in Eastern Time, the big boss delivered another &#8220;blog post&#8221;, announcing several &#8220;organizational alignments&#8221;, which were essentially people moving to new places or promoting to new jobs. The announcement was sent to my email inbox, managed by a dedicated maintenance team, several company-owned data centers across the world, and Microsoft Exchange / Outlook software. It is called a &#8220;blog post&#8221; because there is a website on the Intranet which was organized by date, categories and authors, and on which comments were allowed.</p>

<p>People started to chit-chat around the news, guessing why certain person was or was not promoted or whether the new job fits the person well. It was Thursday afternoon in Europe then, with the mood of espresso. One colleague, originally from U.S., commented: &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the idea of announcing promotions on a blog post. It should be at least a formal email if not a ceremony.&#8221; Another guy responded: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you post it as comments on the blog?&#8221; Laughters. I tried to crack a joke: &#8220;Maybe your promotion will be announced on a tweet. Who knows?&#8221;</p>

<h3 id='what_has_gone_wrong'>What Has Gone Wrong?</h3>

<p>What has gone wrong? Isn&#8217;t this just the normal office gossips as you&#8217;ve seen on the TV shows? Here are my thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why are the blog posts delivered on email?</li>

<li>Why would people think &#8220;blog posts&#8221; are informal?</li>

<li>Why would people laugh at the idea of posting comments on the blog site?</li>

<li>What&#8217;s the value of having the blog system in the company where IE 6 is the only supported browser choice?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are so many matching issues in the story: infrastructure vs. implementation, management vs. employees, traditions vs. evolution. I believe they all stemmed from one thing: how people are measured. Here might be (very probably) how the system was introduced:</p>

<h4 id='management'>Management</h4>

<p>Management thinks of big pictures. The CIO looked around and found the idea of blogging (or pitched by expensive consultants, or read from BusinessWeek, etc.), typically a few years later than it got around the geek community. &#8220;This could be the theme for my next slideshow.&#8221; he figured, &#8220;And it will add points to my incentive package.&#8221; A month later, the executives met at a luxury resort to talk about the future of the company. Blog, along with other shiny new concepts, was promoted to other officers in the frame of &#8220;Next Generation Collaboration&#8221;. CFO challenged on budgeting. Marketing Executive asked about brand value. HR Director thought this could enhance the relationship between senior leadership and staffs. CEO signed off.</p>

<h4 id='development_and_implementation'>Development and Implementation</h4>

<p>It spent two years and $5MM to get through seven milestones. When the system was introduced to everyone, social media has taken over the web. But it didn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>Open source solutions were rejected in the very beginning due to &#8220;security concerns&#8221;. The project had to rework the whole system. As there were concerns around the integration with the existing collaborative systems, the blog system had to be seamlessly connected with Single Sign On, email and other things.</p>

<h4 id='joe'>Joe</h4>

<p>Joe was a staff who is not that tech-savvy. He knew about blogging but never did any. When the he saw the big banner on the Intranet homepage, he clicked the link and figured &#8220;This should be nothing related to me. I only report to my manager who sits in the office next to my cubicle. Why do I need to blog?&#8221;</p>

<p>And later on, Joe started to receive emails from the &#8220;blog&#8221;. He could not reply the email as it was the design to control improper comments. It is not so interesting as Dilbert. &#8220;This has nothing to do with me.&#8221;</p>

<h4 id='david'>David</h4>

<p>David was a middle manager, who was &#8220;one job away from a executive level position&#8221;. On a training session, he was told that blogging could be a great way to build cohesiveness within the team. He was inspired.</p>

<p>He came back and created the blog on the Intranet. Every Friday, he spent one hour to write a blog post to wrap up the week. Sometimes, he used it for announcements. &#8220;I used to email my staffs about these, but it was not interactive - nobody wrote back to me. Now people seem to love the idea of blogging.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were no comments on the blog website though. That was the design. No anonymous comments were allowed.</p>

<p>HR thought that David &#8220;created an effective channel to communicate with his team and has build a great team culture&#8221;. He was promoted.</p>

<h3 id='wrap_up'>Wrap Up</h3>

<p>My questions should be answered in the extended story. I would not call it &#8220;blog&#8221; anymore. It is the same system used for so many years, hierarchical, inefficient, read-only and bureaucratic. It has had different names and looks, but it suffers from the same disease.</p>
